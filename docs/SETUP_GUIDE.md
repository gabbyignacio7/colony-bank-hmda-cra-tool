## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Checks are failing"
- Look at the failed check for details
- Ask AI to help fix the issue
- The auto-formatter often fixes style issues automatically

### "Can't push to main"
- This is intentional! Create a branch and PR instead
- This protects production from accidental changes

### "Dependabot PRs keep appearing"
- This is normal - it's keeping your packages up to date
- Review and merge them weekly
- If tests pass, they're usually safe to merge
