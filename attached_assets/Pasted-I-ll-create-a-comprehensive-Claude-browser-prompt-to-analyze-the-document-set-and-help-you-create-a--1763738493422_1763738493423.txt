🎬 COLONY BANK HMDA/CRA VIDEO PRODUCTION PACKAGE
Complete Deliverables for Gabriel | DeepSee AI
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Video Concept: A 4-minute professional overview video demonstrating how DeepSee AI's automation tool transforms Colony Bank's HMDA/CRA compliance process from an 8-10 hour monthly burden into a streamlined 30-minute workflow.

Recommended Format: Problem → Solution Structure (Option 1) - This format is ideal for Ryan's "overview" request, keeping viewer attention while clearly demonstrating value. It works for multiple audiences: internal team alignment, client testimonials, and sales prospects.

Key Differentiator: Rather than a dry technical walkthrough, this video tells the story of transformation—showing the painful manual reality (relatable to any bank compliance team) and the elegant automation solution. The before/after contrast creates immediate credibility and desire.

Production Approach: Hybrid screen recordings + animated graphics + professional voiceover. No talking head needed—keeps production simple and content focused. AI video tools like Synthesia or Pictory can handle this efficiently with the detailed prompt provided below.

PART 1: DOCUMENT ANALYSIS
A. Current State Process (Manual Workflow)
Based on the PowerPoint process maps and CRA Scrub Procedures documentation, here's the complete manual workflow:

Column 1: Export Files from LP CRA HMDA Remote Server (RED - Manual)

Rate spread calculations
Action taken codes
Time Required: ~4-6 hours (most time-consuming step)
Pain Points:

Extremely tedious manual review
High risk of human error (fatigue, missed issues)
Inconsistent error detection
No automated validation rules
Difficulty tracking recurring error patterns
Charts manually updated (prone to errors)
Column 5: Import Corrections into CRAWiz (PINK - Manual)
Process Steps:

For CRA:

Consolidate corrected data from Excel
Remove symbols used for marking errors
Save as Tab Delimited Text file
Import as Monthly CRA Corrections Import into CRAWiz
Verify no validity errors in CRAWiz
For HMDA:

Consolidate corrected data

Save as Tab Delimited Text
Import as Monthly Update into CRAWiz
Verify no validity errors
Time Required: ~30-45 minutes
Pain Points:

Symbol removal must be perfect (causes import failures)
Import errors require troubleshooting and re-export
No preview before import
Manual verification required
B. Pain Points & Problems (Consolidated)
Time & Efficiency:

Total monthly time investment: 8-10 hours spread across multiple days
Process broken across 5 separate stages requiring constant context switching
Waiting for exports, imports, and geocoding creates dead time
Month-end crunch creates stress and potential for rushed errors
Error Risk:

Manual data entry and copy/paste introduces transcription errors
Fatigue during 4-6 hour scrubbing sessions reduces accuracy
Inconsistent error detection (what one person catches, another might miss)
Symbol marking system prone to mistakes (wrong symbol, wrong column)
No validation until final import (errors discovered late)
Data Quality Issues:

Duplicate records frequently appear despite system checks
Geocoding failures require manual address research
Missing or incomplete data fields discovered late in process
Calculation errors in rate spreads, income ratios not caught early
System Complexity:

Multiple systems: LaserPro (RDP), Encompass, CRAWiz, Excel
Remote server access (RDP) creates latency and connection issues
File version control challenges (which is the latest export?)
Manual file naming and organization prone to inconsistency
Compliance Risk:

Reporting errors could trigger regulatory scrutiny
Late or incomplete submissions create audit risk
Difficulty proving due diligence in manual processes
No audit trail of who changed what and when
Resource Constraints:

Ties up skilled compliance staff for repetitive manual work
Prevents staff from higher-value analysis and strategy work
Creates bottleneck (one person knows the full process)
Difficult to train backup staff due to complexity
Bottlenecks:

Export timing depends on business hours/RDP availability
CRAWiz import processing times unpredictable
Single point of failure if key staff unavailable
Month-end deadline pressure compounds all issues
C. Our Solution (The Automation Tool)
What It Automates:

File Upload & Standardization

Single upload point for SBSL CRA export file (14-column format)
Automatic detection of file format and structure
Standardized column mapping (no manual configuration)
Data Validation (Automated)

14 comprehensive validation rules run automatically:
Date format validation
Required field completeness checks
Numeric field range validation
Code value validation (loan types, action codes)
Cross-field logical validation
Geocode format validation
ULI/Application number format checks
Instant error highlighting with specific messages
Error categorization (critical vs. warning)
Error Detection & Flagging

Automatic symbol/flag insertion for errors (replaces manual marking)
Color-coded severity levels
Sortable error reports by type, severity, date
Duplicate detection across multiple fields
Data Transformation

Automatic removal of error symbols for clean export
Format conversion (CSV → Tab Delimited Text)
Column reordering to match CRAWiz import requirements
Character encoding standardization
Export Generation

One-click export of corrected file
CRAWiz-ready Tab Delimited Text format
Maintains data integrity during transformation
File naming follows Colony Bank conventions
What It Doesn't Automate (And Why):

Initial system exports (LaserPro, Encompass): These require proprietary system access and credentials we don't have direct API access to
CRAWiz import: Final import stays in bank's control for security and audit trail
Complex error correction: Some errors require business judgment (our tool flags them, human decides correction)
Geocoding: CRAWiz handles this during import as part of their service
How It Works (Step-by-Step):

User uploads SBSL CRA export file (CSV with 14 columns)
System validates file structure - confirms column count, headers, data types
Automated validation engine runs - all 14 rules execute in seconds
Error report generated - shows all issues found, organized by type and severity
User reviews flagged errors - can sort, filter, and prioritize corrections
User makes corrections in the interface or downloads marked file for Excel corrections
System re-validates corrected data to ensure fixes worked
Clean export generated - one-click download of CRAWiz-ready file
Import into CRAWiz - user completes final import with validated data
Time Savings Achieved:

Before: 8-10 hours monthly
After: 30 minutes monthly
Savings: ~7.5-9.5 hours per month = 95% time reduction
Annual savings: ~90-115 hours = 2-3 weeks of work
Benefits Delivered:

Efficiency: Frees compliance staff for strategic work
Accuracy: Automated validation catches errors humans miss
Consistency: Same rules applied every time
Speed: Validation in seconds vs. hours
Audit Trail: Logged validation history and changes
Scalability: Handle increased loan volume without adding staff
Reduced Stress: No more month-end scramble
Training: New staff can be productive immediately
Compliance Confidence: Systematic validation reduces regulatory risk

PART 3: DETAILED SCRIPT OUTLINE & NARRATION
SCENE 1: Opening Hook
Duration: 30 seconds
Visuals: Dark screen fades to someone staring at an overwhelming Excel spreadsheet, clock showing "11:47 PM", calendar showing month-end
Screen Elements: Text overlay: "Every month, the same nightmare..."
Tone: Empathetic, ominous buildup

NARRATION: "For banks across America, month-end means one thing: HMDA and CRA compliance hell. Eight to ten hours of manual data entry, error checking, and spreadsheet wrangling. It's tedious. It's error-prone. And for Colony Bank, it was stealing their compliance team's most valuable resource—time. But not anymore."

SCENE 2: The Current State Problem
Duration: 75 seconds
Visuals: Animated process map showing the 5-column workflow, screen recordings of multiple systems, Excel with hundreds of rows, manual error marking with symbols
Screen Elements:

Animated highlight of each step as narrated
Timer ticking up to show cumulative time
Text overlay: "5 Systems. 20+ Manual Steps. 10 Hours." Tone: Building frustration, documentary-style
NARRATION: "Let's walk through Colony Bank's old process. First, log into a remote server to export files from LaserPro—30 minutes just to get the data out. Then, manually import into CRAWiz, a third-party compliance platform. But wait—you need to check for duplicates. Manually. Every single record.

Next, export the current month's data and open it in Excel. This is where it gets painful. Copy the data into an 'Original' tab, then into a 'Corrections' tab. Now comes the worst part: four to six hours of manually reviewing every single loan record. Mark errors with symbols. Missing geocodes? Symbol. Invalid loan type? Symbol. Bad dates? Symbol. Update your error charts manually. One mistake here, and you risk regulatory penalties.

Finally, consolidate your corrections, carefully remove all those symbols—if you miss even one, the import fails—save as Tab Delimited Text, and import back into CRAWiz. Cross your fingers and verify there are no errors. If there are? Start over.

This happens every single month. Ten hours of manual labor. Five different systems. Countless opportunities for human error."

SCENE 3: The Hidden Costs
Duration: 30 seconds
Visuals: Split screen showing: Compliance staff looking exhausted, regulatory fine document, chart showing "Time vs. Strategic Work", calendar with mounting deadlines
Screen Elements:

Text overlays with dollar amounts: "$8,625 annual labor cost", "$6,000 error correction costs", "Risk: $10,000+ penalties" Tone: Serious, urgent
NARRATION: "But time wasn't the only cost. Manual processes mean human errors. And in HMDA and CRA reporting, errors mean regulatory penalties, corrective action plans, and reputational damage. Colony Bank's compliance team wasn't just losing time—they were losing sleep. And losing their capacity to focus on strategic compliance initiatives that actually move the business forward."

SCENE 4: The Solution Reveal
Duration: 45 seconds
Visuals: Fade to clean, modern interface of DeepSee AI tool, DeepSee logo animation, interface highlights
Screen Elements:

Text overlay: "DeepSee AI: Intelligent Automation for HMDA/CRA"
Highlight key features as mentioned Tone: Confident, optimistic, solution-oriented
NARRATION: "Colony Bank partnered with DeepSee AI to transform this nightmare into a streamlined, automated workflow.

DeepSee built a custom automation tool that takes the 10-hour monthly burden and reduces it to 30 minutes. Here's how: The tool automatically validates HMDA and CRA data against fourteen comprehensive compliance rules—instantly. It flags errors with precise, actionable messages. It eliminates manual symbol marking, manual duplicate checking, and manual format conversions.

The result? One upload. Seconds of validation. One clean export. Ready for CRAWiz. No more spreadsheet hell."

SCENE 5: How It Works - Demo
Duration: 75 seconds
Visuals: Screen recording of actual tool interface showing:

File upload

Error details with specific messages
Clean export download
Screen Elements:
Step numbers (Step 1, Step 2, etc.) overlaid
Highlight automated validation rules firing
Zoom on specific error examples Tone: Clear, educational, impressive
NARRATION: "Here's the tool in action. Step one: Upload your SBSL CRA export file—just drag and drop. The system immediately validates the file structure: fourteen columns, correct data types, proper formatting.

Step two: Automated validation. In seconds—not hours—the tool runs fourteen comprehensive rules. Application number uniqueness? Checked. Required fields complete? Checked. Date formats valid? Checked. Loan amounts within acceptable ranges? Checked. Census tract codes valid? Checked. All of it, automatically.

Step three: Review the results. The tool generates a detailed error report, color-coded by severity. Critical errors in red. Warnings in yellow. Every error includes the exact line number, field name, and a clear explanation. No guessing. No manual hunting.

Step four: Make corrections. You can fix errors right in the interface or download the flagged file for bulk corrections in Excel. When you're done, re-upload, and the tool instantly re-validates.

Step five: Export. One click. The tool generates a CRAWiz-ready Tab Delimited Text file—symbols removed, format perfect, ready to import. What used to take ten hours now takes thirty minutes."

SCENE 6: The Results

Screen Elements:
Text overlays: "95% Time Reduction", "115 Hours Saved Annually", "$15,000+ Annual Value"
Colony Bank logo with testimonial quote (if available) Tone: Triumphant, confident, credible
NARRATION: "The transformation? Dramatic. Colony Bank went from ten hours per month to thirty minutes. That's a ninety-five percent reduction. One hundred fifteen hours saved annually. That's almost three weeks of work—freed up for strategic initiatives.

But it's more than time. It's accuracy. It's compliance confidence. It's reduced stress. And it's fifteen thousand dollars in measurable annual value. Colony Bank's compliance team isn't drowning in spreadsheets anymore. They're driving strategic value."

🎬 COLONY BANK HMDA/CRA VIDEO PRODUCTION PACKAGE
Complete Deliverables for Gabriel | DeepSee AI
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Video Concept: A 4-minute professional overview video demonstrating how DeepSee AI's automation tool transforms Colony Bank's HMDA/CRA compliance process from an 8-10 hour monthly burden into a streamlined 30-minute workflow.

Recommended Format: Problem → Solution Structure (Option 1) - This format is ideal for Ryan's "overview" request, keeping viewer attention while clearly demonstrating value. It works for multiple audiences: internal team alignment, client testimonials, and sales prospects.

Key Differentiator: Rather than a dry technical walkthrough, this video tells the story of transformation—showing the painful manual reality (relatable to any bank compliance team) and the elegant automation solution. The before/after contrast creates immediate credibility and desire.

Production Approach: Hybrid screen recordings + animated graphics + professional voiceover. No talking head needed—keeps production simple and content focused. AI video tools like Synthesia or Pictory can handle this efficiently with the detailed prompt provided below.

PART 1: DOCUMENT ANALYSIS
