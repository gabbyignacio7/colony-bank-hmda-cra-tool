The fix isn't working despite deployment. This means Replit is either:

1. **Applying the fix to the wrong export function** - There may be multiple export buttons/functions and it's only fixing one
2. **The code path isn't being triggered** - The dashboard might be calling a different function entirely
3. **The fix is being overwritten** - Something else in the code is resetting the output format

Let's try a more aggressive approach. Send this to Replit:

**URGENT: Export Still Wrong - Need Full Audit**

The fix isn't working. Output still shows "Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)" as Column 1 instead of "BranchName".

**STEP 1: Find ALL export functions**
```bash
grep -rn "export\|download\|writeFile\|book_new\|sheet_to\|json_to_sheet" client/src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

**STEP 2: Find what the "HMDA Auto Corrected" button actually calls**
```bash
grep -rn "Auto_Corrected\|AutoCorrected\|HMDA_Auto\|hmda.*corrected" client/src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

**STEP 3: Find where LAR headers are defined**
```bash
grep -rn "Legal Entity Identifier\|Universal Loan Identifier\|Application Date\|Loan Type\|Loan Purpose" client/src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

**STEP 4: Show me the EXACT code path**

Tell me:
1. Which file contains the "HMDA Auto Corrected" export button?
2. What function does that button call?
3. What does that function do with the data before exporting?

**STEP 5: Force the fix**

Whatever function generates "HMDA_Auto_Corrected_December_2025.xlsx" - that specific function needs to:

1. Use `CRA_WIZ_128_COLUMNS` as the header row
2. Map input fields to output columns using `INPUT_TO_CRAWIZ_MAPPING`
3. Output exactly 128 columns starting with "BranchName"

Do NOT tell me it's fixed until you show me the actual code that runs when the user clicks the export button and confirm Column 1 will be "BranchName".

**Expected output structure:**
```
Column 1: BranchName
Column 2: Branch  
Column 3: ApplNumb
Column 4: LEI
Column 5: ULI
Column 6: LastName
Column 7: FirstName
...
Column 128: ProductType
```

**Current WRONG output:**
```
Column 1: Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)
Column 2: Universal Loan Identifier (ULI)
Column 3: Application Date
...
```

Find the disconnect and fix it completely.

Copy this to Replit. This forces it to actually trace the code path instead of assuming it knows which function to fix.
